## Coding Style & Guidelines

- Whenever possible, prioritize code readability over code efficiency.
- In React code, props are always sorted in ascending alphabetical order, and object properties are also sorted that way if possible.
- Always write code that's short and concise. Make good use of early return techniques, and be careful not to create too much depth in conditional statements or loops.
- For object-type properties (e.g. React props) or types or interfaces, always sort in alphabetical order whenever possible.
- Always keep variable and property names concise but clear.
- Always maintain a clear separation of concerns. However, be careful not to over-segregate, such as through premature optimization.
- You should always write your code in a way that makes it easy to unit test.
- Comments shouldn't be used unless absolutely necessary. Write readable code that can be understood without comments, and only include comments for unavoidable business logic.
- Variable values ​​should be separated into constants whenever possible. Avoid creating magic numbers.
